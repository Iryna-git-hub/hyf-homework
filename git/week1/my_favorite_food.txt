An Apple Pie Recipe
Ingredients:

6–7 tart apples (like Granny Smith), peeled and sliced

3/4 cup sugar

2 tbsp all-purpose flour

1 tsp cinnamon

1/4 tsp nutmeg

1 tbsp lemon juice

1 tbsp butter

1 egg (for egg wash)

1 double pie crust (store-bought or homemade)

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F).

Prepare filling: In a bowl, toss apple slices with sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice.

Assemble pie: Place bottom crust in a 9" pie pan. Fill with apple mixture. Dot with butter. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut slits to vent.

Brush top with beaten egg for golden color.

Bake for 45–50 minutes, until crust is golden and filling is bubbling.

Cool for at least 2 hours before serving.
